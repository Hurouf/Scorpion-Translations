# Scorpion Translations

This repository will be used as the offical platform for people to upload translations for Scorpion. Follow the one of the instructions below for submitting translations.

# Instructions for GitHub
1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy the "base.lproj" folder and rename it to the language you are translating to. For example, the Spanish translation lproj would be renamed to "es.lproj".
3. Go through each .string file inside that folder and translate the right part of the equals sign.
4. Make a pull request and fill out this in the comment section:
      - Language:
      - Twitter username:
5. Done!

# Instructions for Alternative
1. Download this GitHub repo.
2. Follow the same instructions from before for translating.
3. Upload the translations to any other platform (i.e Google Drive)
4. In the root folder create a text file and put the information asked i step 4 in that file.
5. Send me the link via Discord or Twitter.

Once translations are submitted I will personally verify them and add them to Scorpion's source code. Proper credits will be given inside Scorpion's preferences.

**NOTE**: The first person that submit a translation for a specific language will be the one I will credit, so be fast.
